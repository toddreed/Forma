# Forma

Forma is an Objective-C library for implementing forms, settings, and inspector view controllers.

**Warning**: this project is unsupported, not under active development, and not intended for a general audience. I originally wrote the library for my own projects a long time ago and have since incorporated into other projects for clients. I continue to support the library for these audiences, but otherwise donâ€™t plan on maintaining the library.
