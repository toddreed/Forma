# Contributing

Note that Forma is **not** under active development and it’s been released under an open source license primarily so it can be incorporated in my client work. Any maintenance that I do is generally for a specific personal or client need. Because of this, I am not seeking or encouraging contributions from outside. However, if you end up using Forma and would like to make a contribution, please [contact me](mailto:mail@toddreed.name) first to discuss.

[Bug reports](https://github.com/toddreed/Forma/issues) are welcome.

Because Forma is not supported, I don’t want to add it to CocoaPods, which would increase its exposure and support overhead. There is, however, a podspec file, so it can be used with CocoaPods with:

```
pod 'Forma', :git => 'https://github.com/toddreed/Forma.git'
```
